## ✨ Features  
✔️ Cleaned and preprocessed messy datasets  
✔️ Performed **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** to identify trends and outliers  
✔️ Visualized **price distribution, mileage impact, and fuel type influence**  
✔️ Built **Power BI dashboards** for real-time interaction  
✔️ Gained **business insights** for decision-making  

---

## 📊 Key Insights  
- **Car Prices**: Strongly influenced by **fuel type, transmission, and brand**  
- **Mileage vs Price**: Higher mileage often relates to lower prices  
- **Engine Size**: Larger engines tend to have higher costs but lower fuel efficiency  
- **Fuel Trends**: Petrol cars dominate, but **diesel and hybrid** options show different pricing patterns
